Joscha Krug :: OXID Cache
=============================
A caching module to help tweaking the performance of your OXID eShop.

This module is a new and better version of the module described in the OXID Cookbook with the name ocb_staticcache.

Please keep in mind. This is ways more simple then the OXID eShop high performance option.
If you have a large shop and need a reverse proxy cache think of that well maintained solution.
The performance when really skipping the full application will be MUCH better and will keep your servers on nicer temperatures. 

If you need help, feel free to ask me or my team from [ScaleCommerce](https://scale.sc).

If you have questions to the [Makaira](https://www.makira.io/) project, we're also happy to help you.

What it does
------------

It implements some methods to make OXID eShop faster:
- a fullpage or widget cache
- a base implementation for the backends (file for single server, Redis (planned) for distributed setups)
- _planned:_ a hook so the cache can be invalidated on Makaira touches
- _planned:_ a cache class to reduce queries by saving stuff temporarily in the OXID Registry
- _planned:_ an option to retrieve the full data from Makaira so you don't need SQL queries anymore to build the product objects.
